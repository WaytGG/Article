            <b>Symphony of the Seas</b> is an Oasis-class cruise ship owned and operated by Royal Caribbean
            International.
            She was built in 2018 in the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France, the fourth in
            Royal Caribbean's Oasis class of cruise ships.
            At 228,081 GT, she is the largest cruise ship in the world by gross tonnage, surpassing her sister ship
            Harmony of the Seas, also owned by Royal Caribbean International.

            <h4>Description and design</h4>
            <p>
                <i>Symphony of the Seas</i> measures 361.011 metres (1,184 ft 5.0 in) in length and has a gross tonnage
                of
                228,081 across 18 decks. She can accommodate 5,518 passengers at double occupancy up to a maximum
                capacity of 6,680 passengers, as well as a 2,200-person crew. There are 16 decks for guest use, 22
                restaurants, 4 pools and 2,759 cabins.
            </p>

            <p>
                Symphony of the Seas is about 30 metres (98 feet) longer than the largest military ships ever built, the
                U.S. Nimitz-class aircraft carriers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Facilities include a children's water park, a full-size basketball court, an ice-skating rink, a zip
                line that is 10 decks high, a 1400-seat theater, an outdoor aquatic theater with Olympic-height
                platforms, and two 43-foot (13 m) rock-climbing walls. There is also a park
                containing over 20,000 tropical plants.
            </p>

            <p>
                Symphony of the Seas is powered onboard by six marine-diesel sets each composed of three 16-cylinder
                Wärtsilä 16V46D common rail engines and three 12-cylinder Wärtsilä 12V46D engines.
            </p>

            <p>
                The energy-efficient design of Symphony of the Seas requires less shipboard power generation, with 85 MW
                versus the 100 MW normally found on Oasis class ships. One of the key design features is the use of
                only LED or fluorescent lights in order to avoid the heat generation from incandescent bulbs, thereby
                reducing the load on air conditioning systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additional energy efficiency is accomplished by using a 2 MW steam turbine to recover waste heat from
                the engines and converting it into energy to power a portion of the onboard hotel load.
            </p>

            <p>
                For propulsion, Symphony of the Seas uses three 20,000 kilowatt azipod main engines, which are electric
                thrusters. These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide
                rotatable propellers. In addition to the three main engines, there are four bow thrusters used for
                docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7,380 horsepower.
            </p>

            <p>
                Among the Oasis-class ships, Symphony of the Seas uses 25% less fuel due to the implementation of a new
                system that releases tiny air bubbles under the hull to enable the vessel to glide more smoothly through
                the water. The air layer also reduces excitation from the propellers, which cuts noise and vibration
                levels in the aft part of the ship.

            <h4>Construction and career</h4>

            <p>On 29 October 2015 the vessel's keel was laid by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in
                Saint-Nazaire, France. Symphony of the Seas floated out on 9 June 2017. Actors Alexa Vega, Carlos
                Pena Jr. and their 23-month-old son Ocean were chosen as the "Godfamily" of the ship, marking the first
                time in the industry that a family was a ship sponsor. The christening ceremony took place in Miami
                in November 2018.From 15 to 18 February 2018 the cruise ship underwent sea trials and was
                formally turned over to Royal Caribbean International on 23 March. On 24 March the ship left
                Saint-Nazaire for Málaga under the command of Rob Hempstead, arriving on 27 March, and arrived
                at the vessel's first homeport of Barcelona, Spain on 29 March.
            </p>

            <p>
                Symphony of the Seas in Naples, Italy
                On 31 March 2018 Symphony of the Seas offered her first passenger cruise and began her maiden voyage
                on 7 April for a week-long trip through the Mediterranean.
            </p>

            <p>
                During her first season Symphony of the Seas continued to sail on seven-night Western Mediterranean
                cruises from Barcelona. She repositioned on 28 October and arrived on 9 November at her new home port at
                the Royal Caribbean terminal at PortMiami in Florida, United States to provide cruises of the
                Caribbean.
            </p>

            <p>
                In January 2019, while docked in Nassau, Bahamas, a passenger jumped overboard and survived. The
                passenger and his friends were turned over to law enforcement, not charged, and required to return home
                at their own expense.
            </p>

            <p>
                In August 2019, an Australian passenger died after going overboard during a seven-day cruise of the
                Caribbean. His body was recovered shortly afterwards by the ship's officials.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the COVID-19 pandemic on cruise ships, Royal Caribbean suspended all service across most of its
                fleet, including Symphony of the Seas. A 27-year old crew member from the housekeeping
                department was medically evacuated in March 2020 and subsequently died from COVID-19 in April
                2020. The family later sued Royal Caribbean for wrongful death.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2020, Channel 4 in the United Kingdom aired a behind-the-scenes show featuring Symphony of the Seas
                called Billion Pound Cruise. The three-part series was filmed at the end of 2019 and covers the
                on-board experiences.
